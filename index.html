									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<div class="features">
				    <div class="features">
                    <p id="first" align=justify>I have more than <strong>seven years</strong> of experience leading and supporting communications and marketing functions in higher education. Currently, I am the marketing coordinator for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at George Mason University. My role includes creating and disseminating effective marketing content for the diverse departments in CHSS, identifying and anticipating communication trends in higher education and business, and analyzing digital applications and social media platforms used by prospective graduate and undergraduate students. 
            
                    <p align=justify>I have established strong working relationships with CHSS faculty and staff as well as other communication and marketing colleagues from across campus. I effectively collaborate with my coworkers to ensure outstanding product delivery, whether it is a written article, communication campaign, or social media post. I also have extensive experience promoting college achievements through print and digital articles, email communications, and social media, including the launch of a CHSS LinkedIn profile that now has more than 150 organic followers.</p>
        
                    <p align=justify>In my previous position as a Media Strategist at Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I assisted in the development and implementation of marketing and communication strategies at this private, liberal arts institution. My position included creation and media dissemination of content, as well as management of the marketing department’s budget and spending. I served as the college’s point of contact for contracted print vendors, photographers, graphic designers, and writers. I regularly created and coordinated promotional content for departmental brochures and print publications and worked with local media outlets for news stories.</p> 

                    <p align=justify>An important responsibility was the coordination of the college’s quarterly alumni magazine, Exchange. I wrote many of the articles that appeared in the publication, while also serving as the project lead and coordinator for content providers, the graphic designer, and the print vendor. These responsibilities provided a unique platform to communicate the college’s message in a compelling way and also strengthened my abilities in product production, adaptability, and deadline maintenance.</p>

                    <p align=justify>I am experienced in using content management systems likes Hobsons Radius and TargetX and I have created extensive web-based content for CHSS, Cedar Crest College, and private businesses using writing styles and techniques designed to maximize search engine optimization.</p>

                    <p align=justify>I am presently pursuing a master’s degree in communication at George Mason University in order to further expand my skills as well as create a deeper strategic perspective on communication issues affecting organizations and individuals.</p>
